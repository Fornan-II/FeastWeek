It's happening again
The forests we burned... the air is choked with its ash.
I can't breathe
We were promised venison...
Where are our hunters now?
I'm so hungry...
I need... to eat...
We cleared the forests for land to feed ourselves... but the hunger won't go away
There was so much to be gained...
Did we do this?
"The animals kept withdrawing deeper, and the soil always turned to dust"
We've conquered the forest...
Such an enormous creature the hunters brought back that day...
It was supposed to be a celebration to the end of our problems...
The parade... we watched with such hunger...
The sight of that catch... the smell of burning wood... the emptiness of our stomachs...
When will we eat?
Please...
The ash is blinding...
So many mouths to feed...
