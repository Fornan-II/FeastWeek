The forests... now the air is choked with its ash...
We were promised venison...
The hunters caught less and less...
So hungry...
I need... to eat...
We cleared the forests for farmland... but the crops refused to grow.
Did we do this?
"The animals kept withdrawing deeper, and the land we cleared just turned to dust."
Such an enormous creature the hunters brought back that day...
The sight of that catch... the smell of smoke from the forests... the emptiness of our stomachs...
The ash... it's blinding...
So many mouths to feed...
"The sight of that catch... I licked my lips with anticipation, only to taste the smoke on the air"
